This dashboard analyzes vibration data from a belt-driven system to detect misalignment or wear.

Analysing the vibration data in the frequency domain provides critical insights that are not as easily observed in the time domain. By converting the data to the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we can identify specific frequency components associated with various mechanical behaviours and potential faults within the system.

When FFT is applied directly to the raw signal, a large spike may appear at 0 Hz ‚Äî this is a **DC offset**. Since it doesn‚Äôt provide useful mechanical information, we remove it by subtracting the **mean of the signal** before computing the FFT.

#### üîç Key Frequency Components to Monitor:
- **Belt Frequency (fr):** Main belt frequency with harmonics at 2fr, 4fr, etc.
- **Drive Speed (n):** Pulley or motor rotation frequency and its harmonics.
- **Half Drive Speed (n/2):** Often reveals misalignment or load imbalance issues.

üß† **Note**: The dataset contains 10,000 samples collected over 100 seconds, giving a sampling rate of **100 Hz**. However, if you're seeing valid content up to 5,000 Hz, then the true sampling rate is **10,000 Hz**. This has now been correctly reflected in the frequency axis.
